This store was implemented using Redux; however, it is currently deactivated and not being utilized in the main project. Its primary purpose is to allow for comparison with other state management approaches or strategies, such as zustand. Although it is not actively used, this store can easily be activated as an alternative to zustand since both were designed for the same project.
